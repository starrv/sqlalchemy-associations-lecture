#2.a ✅ Add delete methods for Pet and Owner to clear the database before each seeding
#----------
#5.✅ Add Delete methods for Job and Handler
  
    #Initialize faker

    #Create an array for species with "CAT" and "Dog"

    #Create an array of cat breeds
   
    #Create an array of dog breeds
 
    #Create an array of temperaments 
    
    #Create an empty array for owners
 
    #Create a for loop that iterates 50 times
   
        #Create an owner using data from faker
       

        #Use .add and .commit to save the owner one at a time, so we maintain the owner ID in our instance.
       
        #Append the owner to the owners array
       
    
    #Create an empty pets array
    
    #Create a for loop that iterates over the owners array
  
        #Create a for loop that iterates 1 - 3 times
      
            #Use faker and the species, cat breeds, dog breeds and temperament array to create a pet

#3✅ run the seed file and head over to debug.py to test out your one to many

#5.✅ Create a empty array set to handlers
    
    #Create a for loop that iterates 50 times
    
        #Create a handler with faker data

    #Create an empty array and set it to jobs
    
    #Create a for loop that iterates over the handlers array
   
        #Create a for loop that iterates 1 - 10 times
        
            #Create a Job using faker, the request array and pets array
            
            #append the job to the jobs array
               
        #Bulk save the jobs (we wont need their id)
